# Summary

The **Circuit Breaker Demo** provides a lightweight Python implementation of the *Circuit Breaker* design pattern, a proven strategy to improve resilience and fault tolerance in distributed systems. The circuit breaker prevents cascading failures by temporarily halting requests to downstream services when repeated errors occur, allowing the system to recover gracefully under high load or partial outages.

This project demonstrates how resilience patterns can be applied to everyday API integrations, with clear examples simulating real-world scenarios such as peak traffic events and service degradation. The implementation is designed for educational use and as a reusable component for developers exploring system reliability techniques.

# Statement of Need

Modern distributed applications rely heavily on interconnected services and APIs. When one component fails or becomes slow, the failure can propagate, degrading the entire system. Architects and developers therefore require modular, testable tools to model and experiment with resilience mechanisms before production deployment.

The **Circuit Breaker Demo** fills this gap by offering an open-source, minimal implementation that demonstrates:
- The transition between **Closed**, **Open**, and **Half-Open** circuit states.
- Configurable thresholds for failure and recovery.
- Simple integration into Python services and microservice-based systems.
- Logging and metrics hooks for monitoring and visualization.

This software is especially useful for:
- Developers learning fault-tolerance principles.
- Educators demonstrating system resilience in distributed systems courses.
- Researchers modeling reliability patterns for microservices.

# Implementation

The library implements a class-based `CircuitBreaker` abstraction that wraps function calls and monitors exceptions. When failures exceed a threshold, the breaker enters an **Open** state, short-circuiting calls for a cooldown period before transitioning to **Half-Open** for recovery trials.

Example usage:
```python
from circuit_breaker import CircuitBreaker, CircuitBreakerError

breaker = CircuitBreaker(failure_threshold=3, recovery_timeout=10)

@breaker
def call_external_service():
    # simulate transient failure
    raise Exception("Service down")

try:
    call_external_service()
except CircuitBreakerError:
    print("Circuit is open; skipping call")
